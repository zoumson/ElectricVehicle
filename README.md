# Energy Management Strategy for EV Charging Station with ESS and PV Considering PV Generation Uncertainty
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>

<pre>   The current distribution may be unreliable and inefficient if a large amounts of electrical vehicle connect.

This is because the grid technology currently in use has changed very little since it was developed.

An electric vehicle, photovoltaic-based charging station equipped with an energy storage system is proposed

and an algorithm for economic dispatch of the controllable resources in such a station to overcome the grid

shortage is presented. 

   Mathematical models for a subsidy-free integration of photovoltaic and energy storage systems in a charging 
   
station are developed along with a blueprint for optimizing the contract capacity of the charging station.

   A chance-constrained programming method is proposed on grounds of photovoltaic uncertainty to determine the
   
optimal dispatched and contracted power from the utility, such that the charging cost of the electric

vehicle is minimized. Simulations are conducted for a comparison with the existing method.

   Numerical results indicate that our proposed approach provides a range of contract capacity sizes that 
   
benefits both the aggregator of the charging station and electric vehicle users. 

   We showed also how the vehicles could be reliable agents in supporting the grid when photovoltaic panels fail 
   
to be while minimizing their charging cost.</pre> <br>
