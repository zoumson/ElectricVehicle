A probabilistic sequence model is a set of instructions for generating sequences:
i.i.d. (independent identically distributed)
Markov chain:probabilistic nature comes from the transition probabilities

chance constrained programming 

random variable 
A random variable is simply an expression whose value is the outcome of a particular experiment.
Just as in the case of other types of variables in mathematics, random variables can
take on different values

Distribution function of the random variable
Assign probabilities to the possible outcomes(random variable) of the overall  experiment, all sum up to 1.

stochastic variable 
floor/ceilling notation
The notation floor  of x means the greatest integer not exceeding x, and is read â€œfloor of x"

n =[350 350];
mu = 1/20;
alpha = 0.99;
% Calculations
F_ b = icdf('Exponential',alpha,mu);

 a_b = log(1-((1-exp(-20*icdf('Exponential',alpha,mu)))/(1-exp(-20))-alpha)*(1-exp(-20)))/-20;
 f = [-c(1) c(5) 1];
 
 A = [0 1 0;

 lb = [0 0 0]';
